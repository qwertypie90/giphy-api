# Giphy API App

This giphy web app was created in 2017. It is inspired by all 19 of my most favorite American Heroes and is deliciously designed with the 90s and space in mind!

When you click on one of the American Heroes - it'll bring you a list of 10ish gifs of the hero you selected. Click on each to start gif playback.

You can also add your own American Hero but.......don't embarrass me.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and look through the contents. Very straightforward approach to making this in-browser app.
